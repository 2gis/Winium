</p>

Automation framework for Windows platforms. It is free. It is opensource. It is Selenium-based.

# Why Winium?
You have Selenium WebDriver for testing of web apps, Appium for testing of iOS and Android apps. And now you have Selenium-based tools for testing of Windows apps too. What are some of the benefits? As said by Appium:
> - You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as Java, Objective-C, JavaScript with Node.js (in promise, callback or generator flavors), PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Clojure, or Perl with the Selenium WebDriver API and language-specific client libraries.
> - You can use any testing framework.

# Supported Platforms
- Windows Desktop (WPF, WinForms) Apps
